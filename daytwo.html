        - Nothing much happened today, we just had some school discussions and
        lessons. But going home afterwards was terrible. The traffic was intense
        all of a sudden going home and to add to the problem, it was raining so
        hard so I had to stop by mcdonalds to let the rain pass a bit. Decided
        to have my dinner there instead since I dont have any events going on
        today.
