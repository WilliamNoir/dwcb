        - The first subject teacher was a little rough, I didn't really like how
        she handled the class. But I must give myself a reminder to remain
        patient and to keep in mind Romans 12:18 (One of my favorite Bible
        Verses) to be "Peacable" to all people. Maybe it was just a bad day for
        the teacher or she must have been dealing with something. Best to have a
        positive view of others. and Good thing our dismisal for today was 4pm.
        Was able to rest and attend our meeting for today, it was supposed to be
        yesterday but it was moved to wednesday due to the C.O's visit. After
        the meeting we had dinner at mcdonalds.. . again haha. By the time I
        came home I started working on the Journal project for our homeroom
        subject. For some reason it was acctually kinda fun, I really enjoyed
        designing, and designing in general. Hopefully As time passes by I will
        improve the look and feel of the portfolio. Well thats all for now.
