        -Today was quite a busy day, in terms of schoolwork. We were able to
        polish some ideas we had for the project proposal. After finishing the
        proposals, I decided to give myself a quick break. Made some popcorn in
        the kitchen and headed straight to my desk to pick a movie to watch,
        decided to watch a spider-man series. It was quite a slow day to be
        honest. And I was able to clean up a few things here and there. Made me
        feel fully accomplished.
